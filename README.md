# Jenkins Integration

This section describes how to set up a Jenkins job to build, test, and deploy the manik-calculator project.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins installed on your system or available through a remote server
- JDK and Maven installed on the Jenkins build agent
- Docker installed on the Jenkins build agent, if you plan to build and deploy Docker images

## Installing Required Plugins

Before creating a Jenkins job, ensure that the following plugins are installed:

1. Maven Integration plugin
2. Git plugin
3. JaCoCo plugin
4. Clover plugin (optional)
5. Docker Pipeline plugin


To install the plugins, go to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins` > `Available` tab, search for the plugins, select them, and click `Install without restart`.

## Creating a Jenkins Job

1. In the Jenkins dashboard, click on `New Item` in the top-left corner.
2. Enter a name for the job, e.g., `manik-calculator-job`, choose `Freestyle project`, and click `OK`.
3. In the `Source Code Management` section, select `Git` and enter the repository URL. Configure the credentials if required.
4. In the `Build Triggers` section, choose the desired build trigger, e.g., `Poll SCM` or `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`.
5. In the `Build` section, click `Add build step` and select `Invoke top-level Maven targets`. Enter the Maven goals as `clean install`.
6. In the `Post-build Actions` section, add the following actions:
   - Click `Add post-build action` and choose `Record JaCoCo coverage report`. Leave the default settings.
   - (Optional) Click `Add post-build action` and choose `Clover Coverage Report`. Leave the default settings.
   - If you want to build and deploy the Docker image, click `Add post-build action` and choose `Docker Build and Publish`. Configure the repository, Dockerfile location, and other settings as needed.
7. Click `Save`.

Now, you can manually trigger the job or wait for the configured trigger to start the build. Jenkins will build, test, and deploy the manik-calculator project based on the provided configuration.

## Monitoring the Jenkins Job

To monitor the progress and results of the Jenkins job:

1. In the Jenkins dashboard, click on the job name, e.g., `manik-calculator-job`.
2. In the `Build History` section, click on the build number to see its details.
3. On the build details page, you can view the console output, test results, code coverage reports, and other information related to the build.


# Manik-Calculator: SonarQube, Maven and Jenkins Integration

This readme provides a step-by-step guide for installing SonarQube and configuring Jenkins job to integrate with the Manik-Calculator project.

## SonarQube Docker Installation

* Before installing SonarQube using Docker, ensure that your system meets the following prerequisites:

- **Minimum 8GB RAM to run SonarQube container smoothly.**

If you meet the prerequisites, follow these steps to install SonarQube using Docker:

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If it's not installed, download and install Docker from above mentioned command. 


## SonarQube Docker Installation

1. Ensure Docker is installed on your system. If it's not installed, download and install Docker from the official Docker website.

2. Open your terminal and run the following command to download the SonarQube Docker image:

```
docker pull sonarqube
```

3. Once the image is downloaded, run the following command to start a SonarQube container:

```
docker run -d --name sonarqube -p 9000:9000 sonarqube
```

4. Access the SonarQube web interface by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://44.206.250.166:9000`.

5. Once the SonarQube web interface is up and running, log in using the default credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin`

6. Create a new project in SonarQube by following the instructions on the SonarQube web interface. 

## Jenkins Job Configuration

1. Ensure Jenkins is installed on your system. If it's not installed, download and install Jenkins from the official Jenkins website.

2. Open your Jenkins dashboard and navigate to `Manage Jenkins` > `Manage Plugins`. 

3. Install the following plugins:

- SonarQube Scanner
- Git

4. Once the plugins are installed, create a new Jenkins job by clicking on `New Item` and selecting `Freestyle project`.

5. In the `General` section, give your job a name and specify the Git repository URL for the Manik-Calculator project.

6. In the `Build` section, add the following build step:

```
mvn clean package sonar:sonar -Dsonar.host.url=http://44.206.250.166:9000 -Dsonar.login=admin -Dsonar.password=admin
```

This command will run the `mvn` command to build the Manik-Calculator project and then run the SonarQube Scanner to analyze the code and send the results to the SonarQube server running at `http://44.206.250.166:9000`.

7. Save your Jenkins job and run it. Once the job has finished running, you can view the SonarQube analysis report by logging in to the SonarQube web interface and navigating to the project you created in step 6 of the SonarQube Docker installation section.

## Hiding SonarQube Password in Jenkins

To hide your SonarQube password in Jenkins, you can use the Jenkins credentials plugin to store your password securely and reference it in your Jenkins job configuration. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Install the Jenkins credentials plugin if it's not already installed.

2. Go to Jenkins dashboard and navigate to `Credentials` > `System` > `Global credentials` > `Add Credentials`.

3. Choose `Username with password` as the kind of credentials.

4. Enter your SonarQube username in the `Username` field.

5. Enter your SonarQube password in the `Password` field.

6. Give the credentials an `ID` and a `Description` for future reference.

7. In your Jenkins job configuration, replace the `sonar.login` and `sonar.password` arguments in the `mvn` command with the following:

```
-Dsonar.login=${SONAR_USER} -Dsonar.password=${SONAR_PASSWORD}
```

This will reference the SonarQube username and password stored in the Jenkins credentials plugin.

8. Under `Build Environment` section of your Jenkins job configuration, add the `Use secret text(s) or file(s)` option.

9. In the `Bindings` section, click on `Add` and choose `Username and password (separated)` option.

10. In the `Username Variable` field, enter `SONAR_USER`.

11. In the `Password Variable` field, enter `SONAR_PASSWORD`.

12. In the `Username Credentials` dropdown, choose the credentials you created in step 2.

13. Save your Jenkins job and run it. The SonarQube password will now be securely stored in Jenkins and not visible in your job configuration.

Congratulations! You have successfully integrated the Manik-Calculator project with SonarQube and Jenkins.
